# Authentication Implementation

## Overview
The ReactLeads application uses Google OAuth authentication exclusively, powered by Supabase Auth. This provides a seamless, secure, and fast sign-in experience.

## Components

### Auth Component (`src/components/Auth.jsx`)
- **Google Sign-In only** - One-click authentication
- Clean, focused interface
- Error handling for authentication issues
- No passwords to remember or reset

### App Component (`src/App.jsx`)
- Session management
- Authentication state checking
- Automatic redirect to Auth component when not logged in
- Session persistence across page refreshes

### Navigation Component (`src/components/Navigation.jsx`)
- Displays current user email
- Sign out button
- User info hidden on mobile devices

## Authentication Flow

1. **Initial Load**
   - App checks for existing session
   - If no session found, Auth component is displayed
   - If session exists, main app is shown

2. **Google Sign-In**
   - User clicks "Continue with Google"
   - Redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
   - After authorization, automatically signed in
   - No email confirmation needed
   - Instant access to the application

3. **Sign Out**
   - User clicks sign out button in navigation
   - Session is cleared
   - User is redirected to Auth component

## Database Integration
- All database operations now include user_id
- Markets are associated with the creating user
- Leads are properly tracked per user

## Testing the Authentication

1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5174
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. Select your Google account
5. You're instantly signed in!
6. Try creating a new market - should work without user_id errors
7. Click sign out to logout and return to auth screen

## Security Notes
- Authentication is handled by Google OAuth
- No passwords stored in the application
- Sessions are managed securely by Supabase
- API keys are stored in environment variables
- Row Level Security (RLS) should be enabled on Supabase tables for production

## Google OAuth Setup Required
To enable Google Sign-In, you must configure Google OAuth in Supabase:
1. See `GOOGLE_AUTH_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
2. Configure Google OAuth credentials in Supabase Dashboard
3. Enable Google provider in Authentication settings

Without this setup, authentication will not work as Google Sign-In is the only authentication method.
